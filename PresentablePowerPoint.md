τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπεν ἄναξ ἀνδρῶν
αὐτόθεν ἐξ έδρης, οὐδ' ἐν μέσσοισιν ἀναστάς·
ὦ φίλοι, ἥρωες Δαναοὶ θεράποντες
ἑσταότος μὲν καλὸν ἀκούειν. οὐδὲ ἔοικεν

And Lord Agamemnon spoke among them there from his seat, not standing up in the middle of them: “O friends, Danaan heroes, attendants of Ares, it is good to listen to one standing.

|[Main Scholion 1]|**Venetus A**|*τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπεν ἂναξ ἀνδρων αγαμεμνων ἀυτοθεν ἐξ έδρης **ὁ δ᾽έν** μέσσοισι ἀναστάς;* ουτω καὶ παρα ἀριστοφανει ἐν δε τηῖ μασσαλιωτικηῖ καὶ χίαι τοῖσι δ' ἀνισταμενος μετέφη κρέιων αγαμεμνων· μηνίν ἀναστεναχων καὶ ὐφ έλκεος ἄλγεα πάσχων. οὕτως ὁ δίδυμοσ.|thus also in Aristophanes. But in the Massaliot And Chian “standing up among them lord Agamemnon spoke/ groaning over anger and suffering pains from his wounds”. Thus Didymus.|
|[Main Scholion 2]|**Venetus A**|αὐτόθεν ἐξ έδρης. ὁτι ζηνοδοτος τοῦτον μὲν οὐκ έγραφεν τον δε προ αυτου μόνον οὕτως, τοῖσι δ' ἀνισταμενος μετεφη κρεῖων αγαμεμνων· ὁ δε αγαμεμνων οὐκ ορθῶς δημηγορεῖ δια την του τραύματος ἀλγηδόνα δι ὁ εμιφέρει ὑποτιμώμενος, καλὸν μεν εστιν ἑστῶτα δημηγορεῖν ὡς δῆλον εστι καθήμενος|(the dotted diple) because Zenodotus did not write this, but only the one before it, thus: “standing up among them lord Agamemnon spoke.” But Agamemnon does not (up)rightly address the people because of the pain of the wound: therefore he adds making an excuse “it is well for one standing to speak”, as it is clear that he is sitting.|
|[Main Scholion 3]|**Venetus A**|εσταστός μὲν καλὸν ἀκοὐειν ; καλῶς ἔχει τοῦ εστῶτος καὶ δημηγοροῦντος ἀκούειν καὶ μὴ ὑποκροὐειν μηδ᾽ ἐμποδίζειν. τοῦτο γὰρ δηλοῖ τὸ ὑβάλλειν χαλεπὸν γὰρ καὶ τῶι πάνυ δεινῶι ἐν ταραχῆ εἰπεῖν. τοῦτο ἀγνοήσας ἀρίσταρχος καὶ οιηθεῖς παραίτησιν τινα ἐκ τοῦ αγαμεμνονος γίνεσθαι παρενέθηκε τὸ ἀυτόθι εξ έδρης; πρῶτον μὲν οὖν τί ἂν καθέζοιτο τὸν αγκῶνα τετρωμένος ἔπειτα οὕτως ἔρρωται ὤστε ολίγον ὕστερον κάπρον ἀποσφάττειν; οὕτως ὁ κοτιαεύς.| it is good to listen to one standing and speaking and not to interrupt or hinder him: for the “uballein” shows this: for it is difficult for one entirely skilled to speak in a tumult. Aristarchus not recognizing this and thinking that Agamemnon was making some excuse added the “there from his seat.” So first, why would he be sitting when he is wounded in the elbow? Then, he becomes so strong as to kill a boar a little later. Thus Kotiaeus.|
|[Venetus B Scholion]|**Venetus B**|μὴ ἀναστὰς . φησὶ γοῦν ἑξῆς. ἀν δ᾽ ἀγαμέμνων ἵστατο. ἢ οὐ προελθὼν εἰς μέσην τὴν ἐκκλησίαν. ἵν᾽ ἦ ἀναστὰς ἐδημηγόρει (οὐκ) ἐν μέσοις, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ τῆς ἕδρας τῶν βασιλέων. ἐπαφρόδιτος δέ φησιν ὅτι καθεζόμενος ἐδημηγόρει ὅπως μὴ ἕκπυστοι οἱ μῦθοι γένωνται ταπεινοὶ ὄντες,ἢ ὅτι τὸ τραῦμα αὐτὸν ἵστασθαι οὐκ ἐᾶι|Not standing up: at any rate it says later “Agamemnon stood up,” either not coming forth into the middle of the assembly, so that? it would be ‘standing up he spoke (not) in the middle of them, but from the seats of the kings’. But Epaphroditus says that he speaks sitting down so that his words would not be heard, being lowly, or because the wound does not allow him to stand.|

#Our Questions

---


Concerning Agamemnon's apology to Achilles in Book 19 of the *Iliad*, what multiforms have been perpetuated regarding his position (sitting or standing)?

Concerning the commentary by multiple editors and editions what implications are encapsulated within these multiforms?

|Kotiaeus|πρῶτον μὲν οὖν τί ἂν καθέζοιτο τὸν αγκῶνα τετρωμένος ἔπειτα οὕτως ἔρρωται ὤστε ολίγον ὕστερον κάπρον ἀποσφάττειν| So first, why would he be sitting wounded in his elbow and then became so strong that in a little time he kills a boar.|
|Epaphroditus (Venetus B)|ἐπαφρόδιτος δέ φησιν ὅτι καθεζόμενος ἐδημηγόρει ὅπως μὴ ἕκπυστοι οἱ μῦθοι γένωνται ταπεινοὶ ὄντες,ἢ ὅτι τὸ τραῦμα αὐτὸν ἵστασθαι οὐκ ἐᾶι|And Epaphroditus says that he (Agamemnon) was speaking sitting down so that his words would not be heard, (the words) being lowly, or that his injury does not allow him to stand|

#Future Paths of Inquiry

- there is decidedly more left to research, explore, and learn about this particular example of multiformity
- one particularly notable way in which we would like to continue this research is to expand our context 
- additionally we think it would be particullarly valuable to do similar and reproducible research of this kind regarding minute multiform examples
